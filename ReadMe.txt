To use the script a xlsx file named "AttendanceSheet.xlsx". Add a column named names to this file and bellow it add the name of everyone in the class rooster.
Close the file (script will not run if file is open) and add the csv files downloaded from blackboard into the same folder as "AttendanceSheet.xlsx". 
If using 2 csv files name one "Attendance.csv" and the other "Attendance2.csv". If using 1 file comment out lines 15-17 and name the file "Attendance.csv".
When running the script the script will make the 2nd column of AttendanceSheet.xlsx colored. The cell will be colored red if the person next to it is missing and green if they were present.
